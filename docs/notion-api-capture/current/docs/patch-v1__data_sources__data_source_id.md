# Update a data source

Updates the [data source](/reference/data-source) object — the properties, title, description, or whether it's in the trash — of a specified data source under a database.

Returns the updated data source object.

Use the `parent` parameter to move the data source to a different `database_id`. If you do so, any existing views that refer to the data source in the current database continue to exist, but become *linked* views. A new standard "table" view for the moved data source is created under the new (destination) database. Use the Notion app to make any further changes to the views; managing views using the API is not currently supported.

Data source properties represent the columns (or schema) of a data source. To update the properties of a data source, use the `properties` [body param](/reference/update-data-source-properties) with this endpoint. Learn more about data source properties in the [data source properties](/reference/property-object) and [Update data source properties](/reference/update-data-source-properties) docs.

To update a `relation` data source property, share the related database with the connection. Learn more about relations in the [data source properties](/reference/property-object#relation) page.

For an overview of how to use the REST API with databases, refer to the [Working with databases](/guides/data-apis/working-with-databases) guide.

### How data sources property type changes work

All properties in pages are stored as rich text. Notion will convert that rich text based on the types defined in a data source's schema. When a type is changed using the API, the data will continue to be available, it is just presented differently.

For example, a multi select property value is represented as a comma-separated list of strings (eg. "1, 2, 3") and a people property value is represented as a comma-separated list of IDs. These are compatible and the type can be converted.

Note: Not all type changes work. In some cases data will no longer be returned, such as people type → file type.

### Interacting with data source rows

This endpoint cannot be used to update data source rows.

To update the properties of a data source row — rather than a column — use the [Update page](/reference/patch-page) endpoint. To add a new row to a database, use the [Create a page](/reference/post-page) endpoint.

### Recommended data source schema size limit

Developers are encouraged to keep their data source schema size to a maximum of **50KB**. To stay within this schema size limit, the number of properties (or columns) added to a data source should be managed.

Data source schema updates that are too large will be blocked by the REST API to help developers keep their data source queries performant. When a schema update is blocked, the error response includes a `validation_error` code with a message identifying the largest property by name, ID, and byte size to help you reduce your schema size.

### Errors

Each Public API endpoint can return several possible error codes. See the [Error codes section](/reference/status-codes#error-codes) of the Status codes documentation for more information.

<Warning>
  **The following data source properties cannot be updated via the API:**

  * `formula`
  * [Synced content](https://www.notion.so/help/guides/synced-databases-bridge-different-tools)
  * `place`
</Warning>

<Info>
  **Data source relations must be shared with your connection**

  To update a data source [relation](https://www.notion.so/help/relations-and-rollups#what-is-a-database-relation) property, the related database must also be shared with your connection.
